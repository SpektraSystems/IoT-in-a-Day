# Exercise 4: Getting started with Azure IoT Edge

## Scenario

With a huge number of deployments of devices, a large amount of data is being collected and send to the cloud. Is it possible to bring intelligence to the Edge?

Fabrikam, Inc. wants to use an IoT Edge gateway device to bring some of the intelligence to the edge for immediate processing. A portion of the data will still be sent to the cloud. Bringing data intelligence to the IoT Edge also ensures that they will be able to process data and react quickly even if the local network is poor.

You have been tasked with prototyping the Azure IoT Edge solution. To begin, you will deploy a Stream Analytics module to the device that will be used to calculate the average temperature and generate an alert notification if process control values are exceeded.

## Overview

In this exercise, you will deploy a Stream Analytics module to the Edge device and generate an alert notification if process control values are exceeded.

You will complete the following tasks as part of this exercise:

* Connect to IoT Edge VM
* Add an Edge Module to the Edge Device
* Deploy Azure Stream Analytics as an IoT Edge Module

The following resources will be created:

![Lab 04 Architecture](media/lab4_architecture.png)

### Task 1: Connect To IoT Edge VM

In this task, you will connect to the IoT Edge VM.

1. On the Azure portal menu, click on **Resource groups**.
 
1. From **iot-{deployment-id}** resource group, click the IoT Edge virtual machine **linuxagentvm-{deployment-id}**.

1. At the top of the **Overview** pane, click **Connect**, and then click **SSH**.

1. On the **Connect** pane, under **4. Run the example command below to connect to your VM**, copy the example command.

    This is a sample SSH command that can be used to connect to the virtual machine that contains the IP Address for the VM and the Administrator username. The command should be formatted similarly to `ssh username@52.170.205.79`.

    > **Note**: The sample command you copied includes **-i <private key path>**, use a text editor to remove that portion of the command, and then copy the updated command into the clipboard.

1. Navigate to Cloud Shell and in the Cloud Shell command prompt, paste the `ssh` command that you updated in the text editor, and then press **Enter**.

1. When prompted with **Are you sure you want to continue connecting?**, type `yes` and then press **Enter**.

1. When prompted to enter the password, enter **Password.1!!** and press **Enter**.

1. Once connected, the terminal command prompt will change to show the name of the Linux VM, similar to the following.

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@linuxagentvm-{deployment-id}:~$
    ```

    This tells you which VM you are connected to.

    > **Important:** When you connect, you will likely be told there are outstanding OS updates for the Edge VM.  We are ignoring this for our lab purposes, but in production, you always want to be sure to keep your Edge devices up-to-date.

1. To confirm that the Azure IoT Edge Runtime is installed on the VM, run the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge version
    ```

    This command outputs the version of the Azure IoT Edge Runtime that is currently installed on the virtual machine.

### Task 2: Add Edge Module to Edge Device

In this exercise, you will add a Simulated Temperature Sensor as a custom IoT Edge Module, and deploy it to run on the IoT Edge Device.

1. If necessary, log in to your Azure portal using your Azure account credentials.
 
1. On your Resource group tile, to open your IoT Hub, click **iothub-{deployment-id}**.

1. At the left of the **IoT Hub** blade, under **Automatic Device Management**, click **IoT Edge**.

1. On the list of IoT Edge Devices, click **turbine-06**.

1. On the **turbine-06** blade, notice that the **Modules** tab displays a list of the modules currently configured for the device.

    Currently, the IoT Edge device is configured with only the Edge Agent (`$edgeAgent`) and Edge Hub (`$edgeHub`) modules that are part of the IoT Edge Runtime.

1. At the top of the **turbine-06** blade, click **Set Modules**.

1. On the **Set modules on device: turbine-06** blade, locate the **IoT Edge Modules** section.

1. Under **IoT Edge Modules**, click **Add**, and then click **IoT Edge Module**.

1. On the **Add IoT Edge Module** pane, under **IOT Edge Module Name**, enter **turbinesensor**

    We will be naming our custom module "turbinesensor"

1. Under **Image URI**, enter **asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor**

    > **Note**: This image is a published image on Docker Hub that is provided by the product group to support this testing scenario.

1. To change the selected tab, click **Module Twin Settings**.

1. To specify the desired properties for the module twin, enter the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
        "EnableProtobufSerializer": false,
        "EventGeneratingSettings": {
            "IntervalMilliSec": 500,
            "PercentageChange": 2,
            "SpikeFactor": 2,
            "StartValue": 68,
            "SpikeFrequency": 20
        }
    }
    ```

    This JSON configures the Edge Module by setting the desired properties of its module twin.

1. At the bottom of the blade, click **Add**.

1. On the **Set modules on device: turbine-06** blade, at the bottom of the blade, click **Next: Routes >**.

1. Notice that a default route is already configured.

    * Name: **route**
    * Value: `FROM /messages/* INTO $upstream`

    This route will send all messages from all modules on the IoT Edge Device to IoT Hub

1. Click **Review + create**.

1. Under **Deployment**, take a minute to review the deployment manifest that is displayed. 

    As you can see, the Deployment Manifest for the IoT Edge Device is formatted as JSON, which makes it pretty easy to read.

    Under the `properties.desired` section is the `modules` section that declares the IoT Edge Modules that will be deployed to the IoT Edge Device. This includes the Image URIs of all the modules, including any container registry credentials.

    ```json
    {
        "modulesContent": {
            "$edgeAgent": {
                "properties.desired": {
                    "modules": {
                        "turbinesensor": {
                            "settings": {
                                "image": "asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor",
                                "createOptions": ""
                            },
                            "type": "docker",
                            "version": "1.0",
                            "status": "running",
                            "restartPolicy": "always"
                        },
    ```

    Lower in the JSON is the **$edgeHub** section that contains the desired properties for the Edge Hub. This section also includes the routing configuration for routing events between modules, and to IoT Hub.

    ```json
        "$edgeHub": {
            "properties.desired": {
                "routes": {
                  "route": "FROM /messages/* INTO $upstream"
                },
                "schemaVersion": "1.0",
                "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
                    "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
                }
            }
        },
    ```

    Lower still in the JSON is a section for the **turbinesensor** module, where the `properties.desired` section contains the desired properties for the configuration of the edge module.

    ```json
                },
                "turbinesensor": {
                    "properties.desired": {
                        "EnableProtobufSerializer": false,
                        "EventGeneratingSettings": {
                            "IntervalMilliSec": 500,
                            "PercentageChange": 2,
                            "SpikeFactor": 2,
                            "StartValue": 20,
                            "SpikeFrequency": 20
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ```

1. At the bottom of the blade, to finish setting the modules for the device, click **Create**.

1. On the **turbine-06** blade, under **Modules**, notice that **turbinesensor** is now listed.

    > **Note**: You may have to click **Refresh** to see the module listed for the first time.

    You may notice that the RUNTIME STATUS for **turbinesensor** is not reported.

1. At the top of the blade, click **Refresh**.

1. Notice that the **RUNTIME STATUS** for the **turbinesensor** module is now set to **running**.

    If the value is still not reported, wait a moment and refresh the blade again.
 
1. Open a Cloud Shell session (if it is not still open).

    If you are no longer connected to the `vm-iot-edge-{deployment-id}` virtual machine, connect using **SSH** as before.

1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt, to list the modules currently running on the IoT Edge Device, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge list
    ```

1. The output of the command looks similar to the following. 

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@linuxagentvm-{deployment-id}:~$ iotedge list
    NAME             STATUS           DESCRIPTION      CONFIG
    edgeHub          running          Up a minute      mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0
    edgeAgent        running          Up 26 minutes    mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0
    turbinesensor    running          Up 34 seconds    asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor
    ```

    Notice that `turbinesensor` is listed as one of the running modules.

1. To view the module logs, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge logs turbinesensor
    ```

    The output of the command looks similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@linuxagentvm-{deployment-id}:~$ iotedge logs turbinesensor
    11/14/2019 18:05:02 - Send Json Event : {"machine":{"temperature":41.199999999999925,"pressure":1.0182182583425192},"ambient":{"temperature":21.460937846433808,"humidity":25},"timeCreated":"2019-11-14T18:05:02.8765526Z"}
    11/14/2019 18:05:03 - Send Json Event : {"machine":{"temperature":41.599999999999923,"pressure":1.0185790159334602},"ambient":{"temperature":20.51992724976499,"humidity":26},"timeCreated":"2019-11-14T18:05:03.3789786Z"}
    11/14/2019 18:05:03 - Send Json Event : {"machine":{"temperature":41.999999999999922,"pressure":1.0189397735244012},"ambient":{"temperature":20.715225311096397,"humidity":26},"timeCreated":"2019-11-14T18:05:03.8811372Z"}
    ```

    The `iotedge logs` command can be used to view the module logs for any of the Edge modules.

1. The Simulated Temperature Sensor Module will stop after it sends 500 messages. It can be restarted by running the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge restart turbinesensor
    ```

    You do not need to restart the module now, but if you find it stops sending telemetry later, then go back into Cloud Shell, SSH to your Edge VM, and run this command to reset it. Once reset, the module will start sending telemetry again.

### Task 3: Deploy Azure Stream Analytics as IoT Edge Module

Now that the **turbinesensor** module is deployed and running on the IoT Edge device, we can add a Stream Analytics module that can process messages on the IoT Edge device before sending them on to the IoT Hub.

#### Review the Stream Analytics Job

1. On the resource group tile, click **iot-{deployment-id}** and select the stream analytics job named **iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}**.

1. Then under Job Topology on the left side of the blade, select Inputs and verify that there is one input job **temperature** already defined.

1. Then select Outputs under Job Topology and verify that there is one output job **alert** already defined.

1. On the left side navigation menu under Configure, click Storage account settings. Then ensure that the iotstorage{deployment-id} storage account is added.

#### Deploy the Stream Analytics Job

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **iothub-{deployment-id}** IoT Hub resource.

1. On the left side navigation menu, under **Automatic Device Management**, click **IoT Edge**.

1. Under **Device ID**, click **turbine-06**.

1. At the top of the **turbine-06** pane, click **Set Modules**.

1. On the **Set modules on device: turbine-06** pane, locate the **IoT Edge Modules** section.

1. Under **IoT Edge Modules**, click **Add**, and then click **Azure Stream Analytics Module**.

1. On the **Edge deployment** pane, under **Subscription**, ensure that the subscription you are using for this course is selected.

1. In the **Edge job** dropdown, ensure that the **iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}** Steam Analytics job is selected.

    > **Note**:  The job may already be selected, yet the **Save** button is disabled - just open the **Edge job** dropdown again and select the **iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}** job again. The **Save** button should then become enabled.

1. At the bottom of the pane, click **Save**.

    Deployment may take a few moments.

1. Once the Edge package has been successfully published, notice that the new ASA module is listed under the **IoT Edge Modules** section

1. Under **IoT Edge Modules**, click **iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}**.

    This is the Steam Analytics module that was just added to your Edge device.

1. On the **Update IoT Edge Module** pane, notice that the **Image URI** points to a standard Azure Stream Analytics image.

    ```text
    mcr.microsoft.com/azure-stream-analytics/azureiotedge:1.0.7
    ```

    This is the same image used for every ASA job that gets deployed to an IoT Edge Device.

    > **Note**:  The version number at the end of the **Image URI** that is configured will reflect the current latest version when you created the Stream Analytics Module.

1. Leave all values as their defaults, and close the **IoT Edge Custom Modules** pane.

1. On the **Set modules on device: turbine-06** pane, click **Next: Routes >**.

    Notice that the existing routing is displayed.

1. Replace the default route defined with the following three routes:
   
   > **Note**: Be sure to replace the `iotstreamjob-edge-{deployment-id}` placeholder with the name of your Azure Stream Analytics job module.
   
    * Route 1
        * NAME: **telemetryToCloud**
        * VALUE: `FROM /messages/modules/turbinesensor/* INTO $upstream`
    * Route 2
        * NAME: **alertsToReset**
        * VALUE: `FROM /messages/modules/iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/turbinesensor/inputs/control")`
    * Route 3
        * NAME: **telemetryToAsa**
        * VALUE: `FROM /messages/modules/turbinesensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}/inputs/temperature")`

    > **Note**: You can click **Previous** to view the list of modules and their names, then click **Next** to come back to this step.

    The routes being defined are as follows:

    * The **telemetryToCloud** route sends all messages from the `turbinesensor` module output to Azure IoT Hub.
    * The **alertsToReset** route sends all alert messages from the Stream Analytics module output to the input of the **turbinesensor** module.
    * The **telemetryToAsa** route sends all messages from the `turbinesensor` module output to the Stream Analytics module input.

1. At the bottom of the **Set modules on device: turbine-06** blade, click **Review + create**.

1. On the **Review + create** tab, notice that the **Deployment Manifest** JSON is now updated with the Stream Analytics module and the routing definition that was just configured.

1. Notice the JSON configuration for the `turbinesensor` Simulated Temperature Sensor module:

    ```json
    "turbinesensor": {
        "settings": {
            "image": "asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor",
            "createOptions": ""
        },
        "type": "docker",
        "version": "1.0",
        "status": "running",
        "restartPolicy": "always"
    },
    ```

1. Notice the JSON configuration for the routes that were previously configured, and how they are configured in the JSON Deployment definition:

    ```json
    "$edgeHub": {
        "properties.desired": {
            "routes": {
                "telemetryToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/turbinesensor/* INTO $upstream",
                "alertsToReset": "FROM /messages/modules/iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\\\"/modules/turbinesensor/inputs/control\\\")",
                "telemetryToAsa": "FROM /messages/modules/turbinesensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\\\"/modules/iotedge-streamjob-{deployment-id}/inputs/temperature\\\")"
            },
            "schemaVersion": "1.0",
            "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
                "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
            }
        }
    },
    ```

1. At the bottom of the blade, click **Create**.

#### View Data

1. Go back to the **Cloud Shell** session where you're connected to the **IoT Edge Device** over **SSH**.  

    If it is closed or timed out, reconnect. Run the `SSH` command and login as before.

1. At the command prompt, to view a list of the modules deployed to the device, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge list
    ```

    It can take a minute for the new Stream Analytics module to be deployed to the IoT Edge Device. Once it's there, you will see it in the list output by this command.

    ```cmd/sh
    demouser@linuxagentvm-{deployment-id}:~$ iotedge list
    NAME                 STATUS           DESCRIPTION      CONFIG
    linuxagentvm-745896  running          Up a minute      mcr.microsoft.com/azure-stream-analytics/azureiotedge:1.0.5
    edgeAgent            running          Up 6 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0
    edgeHub              running          Up 4 hours       mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0
    turbinesensor        running          Up 4 hours       asaedgedockerhubtest/asa-edge-test-module:simulated-temperature-sensor
    ``` 

    > **Note**:  If the Stream Analytics module does not show up in the list, wait a minute or two, then try again. It can take a minute for the module deployment to be updated on the IoT Edge Device.

1. At the command prompt, to watch the telemetry being sent from the Edge device by the `turbinesensor` module, enter the following command:

    ```cmd/sh
    iotedge logs turbinesensor
    ```

1. Take a minute to observe the output.
 
    Output of this event will look similar to the following:

    ```cmd/sh
